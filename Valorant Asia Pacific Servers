For Valorant, they're using the AWS global accelerator, which is announced under AS16509 (i.e: NOT distinguisable from regular AWS/Amazon traffic).

Unfortunately, given that the bulk of the problem is on the inbound path, and since BGP cannot operate at a port level, we will probably require one of the following:

1. Increased preferences via peering at Equinix / SGIX Singapore to Amazon when being exported by your IIG. This will force Amazon to shun your ITC peers and send traffic directly via the IXP.
    See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/routing-and-bgp.html, the most likely community is 7224:7200

2. Set aside a /24 or two that are exclusively assigned to gaming / latency sensitive customers which are not announced to Airtel/Tata/ITC peers at all

In addition, please set a SMW4/5 bound path of choice for AS16509.
